# Cash-Flow-Minimiser

It is a very common scenario to experience where you owe money to someone, who owes money to someone else, and so on in a big loop of debts. This project aims to make this whole process simpler. It finds the quickest way to pay everyone back to minimize the number of transactions. This way, we can avoid unnecessary back-and-forth money transfers and make it easier for everyone to settle their debts. The goal is to create a user-friendly system that helps people navigate these complicated debt networks, making it easier for everyone to pay what they owe without too much hassle.
